# A solution of TSP problem using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)

## Description 
### Grey Wolf Optimization : 
Grey wolf optimization (GWO) is a metaheuristic algorithm that is inspired by the behavior of grey wolves in leadership and hunting (Mirjalili et al., 2014). The algorithm classifies a population of possible solutions into four types of wolves α, β, δ, and ω. The four types are ordered based on the fittest solution, which means that α is considered the best solution and ω is the worst. The new generation is created by updating the wolves in each one of these four groups. This update is based on the first three best solutions obtained from α, β, and δ in the previous generation.

### Traveling salesman problem (TSP) : 
A classic problem in computer science and optimization theory, given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. The problem is typically represented in the form of a weighted graph, where cities are represented by vertices and the distances between them are represented by the weights of the edges connecting the vertices.

### Contribution : 
This solution is a hybridation between GWO and Genetic Algorithm to solve TSP problem, the distances between the cities is defined in a distance metrics.
